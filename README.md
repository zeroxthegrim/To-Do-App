# To-Do-App
To-Do list app using vanilla JS

This was made after following tutorial from youtube content creator "Code Explained". It looks almost exactly the same because I used his Css
style sheet. I wrote my own JavaScript code because the purpose of this project was to get myself more familiar with DOM. This application uses local 
storage to save data.
